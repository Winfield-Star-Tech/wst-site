				Thanks for showing an interest in my Corporation Winfield Star-Tech. I'd like to give you some information initially about myself and then about my corp to ensure that you and the corporation are the best fit.
</p>
<p>
When I started in this game I had very little experience with on-line multiplayer games, so the idea of joining a player run corporation was very alien to me but I was lucky to run in to one of the members of Winfield Star-Tech who were in the process of recruiting. The idea was new to me and a little daunting but I decided to try out the concept. Being really new to the game, the members of the corp were a tremendous help teaching me more about the game and answering a long stream of questions as well as pointing me in the right direction when I didn't even know I was going wrong.
My main activities are mining which I get my main income from which helps paying towards doing Security missions, being in a corp allows me to not only run these missions with friends in a fleet but gives me people to talk to while conducting the hours of mining too.

Winfield Star-Tech was born when Cole Winfield stepped down as the CEO of the well established manufacturing Corp LankTech. Having taken over from the CEO of LankTech to re-organise and structure the Corp Cole handed a restructured and now profit making Corp back to the founder but felt he wanted to build his own Corp from scratch. He went to the starter system of Embod and recruited just six brand new players to teach them the game and begin a corporation,Winfield Star-Tech was born with just seven members on 28/9/2012.
</p>

The Corp consists of a baseline of very experienced players, which are happy to help out with all the problems and questions newbie players may have. We were all new once and WST is known amongst our peers as a Corp that takes in newbie pilots and helps them learn and enjoy the game. We only take in a few newbie pilots every recruitment drive to ensure they receive the attention they need and deserve. New players are initially helped by the Corp to get them into good mining ships and/or mission running ships so they could begin to earn isk for themselves with considerable knowledge on how to fit and fly ships given.
</p>

Winfield Star-Tech as a Corp builds and sells ships to the open market. Our manufacturing is fully up and running and we are able to produce around 500 ships a day at maximum capacity. This means that we have a good income our members are being paid good rates (over 30 billion ISK paid out to Corp members in the last three months) for the minerals they mine that we use for the ship manufacturing. 
</p>
<p>

The Corp as its own entity makes about 3 billion isk a month, some of that has been invested in expanding our infrastructure such as POS's (Player Operated Stations) and Citadels which are being used as a research and manufacturing base. We have an extended blueprint library and now manufacture frigates, destroyers, cruisers, fighters, battle cruisers and battleships as well as major industrial ships. We also get asked to do specific large ship builds, where decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, but we have the ability to build freighters.

Cole Winfield runs the Corp and acts as CEO. He has experience in all areas of the game and began his Eve Career with HAMMER STAR BLADE and Universal Paranoia Alliance becoming their Diplomacy and Recruitment Director before moving into LankTech. As CEO of W-S-T, Cole Winfield has done an impressive job at building a Corp from scratch and turning it into a solid, smoothly running organization. Even with the Corp being at it's current size he still keeps an eye on what's happening at all levels, generally being very attentive. He's kept the enthusiasm and is constantly pushing for us to grow and expand in a rate that doesn't make us stretch ourselves thinner than we can handle. He's happy to help out newbie pilots as well with good advice and tips, always being friendly and forthcoming. At the same time he's not afraid to step up and show real leadership with a firm hand when this is occasionally called for, like in times of war. A combination which, in my opinion, makes a great CEO.

<p>

The overall principle of the Corp is, that it is mutually beneficial. I.e members of the Corp are game-wise and isk-wise better off by being in the Corp compared to soloing, whilst at the same time the Corp is able to support itself and grow steadily as its own entity. This means, for instance, that the Corp as an entity is not indebted to other corps and alliances. That we can support ourselves is evident and our steady growth shows this.

We operate out of a system in high sec in Minmatar space which has been carefully selected and in my view the best region of space for high sec mining in the game for a variety of strategic reasons. The Corp is engaged in many activities. We were originally a Mining and Manufacturing Corp and this is still our main activity. However the Corp has matured and you will find that we do not just run mining fleets offering boosts and free perfect refining of ore. We also run regular mission fleets (in which you can access higher level missions and rewards than you otherwise could). Further, we have our own Wormhole system in which mining yields much more valuable ore than available in high-sec and also enables us to run Sleeper sites. PvP is unavoidable in Eve and despite us not being PvP orientated we do take part in PvP activities which is optional for our members, we run both PvP training and take part in regular PvP roams (see our killboard: https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98140131/) so that members of the Corp can take part in the defence of the corporation when the need arises but also mainly have fun on such roams. Finally we often run more `fun` less intensive activities such as image and story competitions, all with prizes of course.

I have really enjoyed being part of the development of this Corp during my time here, all based on firm foundations for a stable, progressive long term future. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to be involved in such a project with someone who has real and successful experience at running a large corporation and I am sure we can transform the corporation into an even larger and more profitable one. It will be a long road but I believe in loyalty and those who stick with the Corp and put the effort in to work in the interests of the Corp will certainly be better off for it. We tend to be mainly involved in high sec activities (Mining, Mission running etc) but we also take part in PvP. Most of our members mine a lot and what we mine can then be refined and sold to the Corp at a good rate (so you get a good income). These minerals will be used to build the ships the Corp sells to the market, and therefore the Corp makes a little isk that can be reinvested back into the Corp to benefit its members.
</p>
<p>

I honestly believe that being part of a Corporation that is still in developing, is an incredible opportunity for a new player to be a part of, as it will enable you to get support and help in the game and you will be able to grow alongside the growth of the corp. I hope you are as interested and excited by this project as me and you would like to be a part of it. It is also entirely possible that one day you could become a Director of the Corp and help lead it. In fact the corps entire board of Directors is actually made up of players who joined the Corp as newbie pilots just like yourself. We are restricting recruitment to just 20 new personnel so its first come first served.
