Dear Recruit,
</p>
<p>
Thank you for chosing to join Winfield Star-Tech. I hope your capsuleer life with us will be a enjoyable and rewarding one for you. You will be recieving a lot of intial information to help you get started in your Winfield Star-Tech career. Although this my seem onerous at first I strongly recommend you read all the information which is sent to you as it contains important information to aid you. 
</p>
<p>
Please rememeber we are here to help you so if you ever have any questions please feel free to ask in corp chat. We are an anti pirate corp and any criminal acts by our pilots (ganking, stealing ore etc) will result in expulsion from the corp. I would also like to remind you that going into low sec is a very bad idea, you will almost certainly be killed and should only enter low sec if you are in a covert ops ship (which can cloak) or as part of a PvP fleet. There are many tricks played to entice players into low sec, such as setting up very tempting market prices for goods to lure players into a low sec system where they can be ambushed. 
</p>
<p>
You will recieve further Eve-Mails providing you with more information how the corp operates but at the moment you are proberbly wondering `What should I do now?` Below is a check list of things you should do in the immediate future.
</p>
<p>

1. Leave the Winfield Star-Tech Recruitment Waiting Room, this keeps it freed up for people not yet in the corp.
</p>
<p>
2. Set your training queue so that you are training up for a Retriever if you're not there already. This is an excellent starter mining ship and it will help pay for itself in no time.
</p>
<p>
3. If you have not completed all the tutorial career missions in your system, do so before relocating.
</p>
<p>
4. Move all of your equipment and ships to:  Irgrus IV - Moon 13 - TransStellar Shipping Storage . This is our home system and base of operations, you will want to be here as everything is set up to make your life easier here, there are plenty of mission agents nearby. 
</p>
<p>
Fly Safe,
</p>
<p>

<p>
The whole idea behind Winfield Star-Tech is to create a corp which is mutually beneficial for its members, therefore the big question I am sure you are asking is how you can gain by being in the corp. At the moment this is by two main ways. By mining and by missioning. 
</p>
<p>
MISSION RUNNING
</p>
<p>
Mission running fleets are often formed and allows players to take part in missions at higher levels than they currently have access to. I will personally arrange frequent lvl 3 and 4 mission fleets, from which all the rewards (including salvage) are split equally between the participants.
</p>
<p>

MINING
</p>
<p>
Most of us use mining as our main source of income, as this provides a very good income and can be done semi afk. The Corporation is centered around this and the corp will buy any minerals you mine, the corp then uses these minerals to build ships and makes a profit from this. The corp then uses these profits to spend on facilities and projects etc. that benefit the members of the corp. 
</p>
<p>

The first thing you will need to do is to mine ore. When you have mined the ore, you need to take it to Irgrus IV - Moon 13 - TransStellar Shipping Storage. Here you can refine the ore into minerals but at the moment you probably wont have perfect refining skills, so instead you can create a contract to Taha Hakaari setting the price etc. to free (more on how to do this below) and he will refine your ore into minerals with perfect refine skills and contract it back to you for free. Please only do this though in large ore batches as each trip to the corps refining array takes time and so one trip with a lot of ore is better than lots of little trips, he can carry up to 1.1 million m3 of ore. As you are just starting out i am happy to take 50,000m3 loads but after that once you are in a Retriever try to keep it to 100,000m3 minimum batches
</p>
<p>

To create a contract to Taha you need to select all the ore you want refined (use Ctrl+right mouse click) then select create contract. On the next window ensure `item exchange`, and `private` are selected. in `Name` put Taha Hakaari. Then click the `Next` button. on the next screen ensure everything u want refined has an x in the box next to it. then select `next` again. On the next window ensure `I will pay` and `I will recieve` are set to 0.0 and set the expiration to 2 weeks. check all the details and select `Finish`. all refiing will be done and sent back usually around 06:00 to 07:00 Eve time.
</p>
<p>

When you have your minerals you can then sell them to the corp. This benefits both you and the corp as a whole and we encourage you to do so, as we need the minerals to keep our manufacturing running. The corp prices are good prices for the minerals to ensure you benefit by selling them to the corp and if done in Irgrus IV - Moon 13 - TransStellar Shipping Storage  it means you do not have to do lots of hauling runs to move your minerals to a market hub to sell them. To sell your minerals to the corp you will first need to look at the Corp Bulletin board, where you will see a list of `mineral blocks`. To do this go to the Corporation button on the left of your screen (the ringed planet with stars around it icon). On that select the `home` tab and then the `bulletins` tab. On there you will see the prices per unit the corp is currently buying minerals at and the list of `blocks`. The corp buys minerals from players in the form of those blocks for a set amount of ISK to ensure the corp has the correct ratios of minerals in stock for its manufacturing.  The mineral prices are updated regularly.
</p>
<p>

Once you have the price set, you will need to create a contract in  Irgrus IV - Moon 13 - TransStellar Shipping Storage to the Corp. To do this select all the minerals you wish to sell and select `create contract`. Again ensure `Item Exchange` but select `My corporation` in the availability part. click next. Again ensure all you want to sell has an x next to it. Click `Next` leave `I will pay` at 0.0 but then put the value you worked out your minerals cost in `I will recieve`. Again set the `Expiration` to 2 weeks. check all the details and select `Finish`. Again contracts for Minerals will be checked and accepted between 06:00 to 07:00 in the morning, if you have added up your minerals wrong it will be rejected. The mineral prices on the bulletin board do change, so check each time you set up a contract as the mineral values in Eve fluctuate.
</p>
<p>


I hope this information helps you to begin to make Isk whilst being in the corp. If anything is unclear, of course just ask in corp chat.

		</div>
		<div id="corpranks" class="panel-collapse collapse">
			<div class="panel body">
<p>

The Corp runs a corp rank structure. I wanted to find a structure that would both give a reward to those Corp members who work in the interests of the Corp and would provide a guide to who the experienced members of the Corp are to new players who join the corp. To achieve both of these I decided upon a Winfield Star-Tech Corp Rank Structure. Each rank will provide greater access to Corp assets and responsibilities. The rank structure is not implemented as a tool for players to `boss people around` (although at times of war the military ranking structure will require people to follow orders when flying in a war fleet, see below for more details) but is there as a guide to new players as to who can offer advice and experience whilst being a public declaration of how much a given player has helped the corp. Each player will be awarded an Industrial Rank and a Military Rank, and these will be detailed below.
</p>
<p>

Industrial Ranks
</p>
<p>
There are 8 Industrial ranks each with corresponding access to Corp assets. I will be the top rank, being CEO and the board of directors will all be given a general title of director, with responsibilities listed afterwards e.g. Director Manufacturing, Director Research etc. the lowest rank of Apprentice will be awarded to players who join the Corp for a one month probationary period, after which they will automatically be promoted to Engineer. At higher levels it is hoped that players will work under a Director to help supervise a particular area of running the corp. All awards of ranks will be decided upon by the board of directors, a director can recommend someone for promotion to a rank and the board will then vote on the awarding of the rank. The ranks in order from top to bottom are as follows:
</p>
<p>

1. CEO<br/>
2. Director<br/>
3. Manager<br/>
4. Supervisor<br/>
5. Foreman<br/>
6. Harvester<br/>
7. Engineer<br/>
8. Apprentice<br/>

</p>
<p>
Military Ranks
</p>
<p>
As with the Industrial Ranks there are 8 Military Ranks. The Military ranks will also require people to follow the orders of a higher ranking member when you are in a fleet with them during times of war or when PvPing this is due to the fact that during these times there is not the time to debate things, simply put if you take part in this area you have to follow the orders your fleet commander gives. As with the Industrial ranks the Military ranks can be recommended by a director and voted on by the board of directors. It is expected however that it will most likely be the Director of Defence making the recommendations for the military ranks. You will be awarded a military rank based on your ability to follow orders, conduct your self during military exercises and ability shown during PvPing and War Decs. We plan to allow greater access to war materials from the Corp with the higher ranks. As with industrial ranks the bottom rank is awarded to new players to the Corp which will automatically be promoted to the next rank up upon completion of their one month probationary period. The ranks from highest to lowest are as follows:
</p>
<p>

1. Admiral<br/>
2. Vice-Admiral<br/>
3. Commodore<br/>
4. Captain<br/>
5. Wing Commander<br/>
6. Squadron Leader<br/>
7. Flight Lieutenant<br/>
8. Officer Cadet<br/>
</p>
<p>

I hope you feel as we do that these changes will both encourage and reward yourself and others to take an active role in the fortunes of Winfield Star-Tech.

<p>
I would like to remind players of one of the major things the corps offers it's members is, as a ship manufacturing corp we can of course sell our members ships. The corp sells ships to the market to `Buy` orders ensuring they are profitable compared to their mineral prices. What we do for Corp members is sell ships to them for the `buy` order price which is always lower than the `Sell` order you would purchase at off the market.
</p>
<p>

I often get asked what ships we can make. Well the list is extremely long. We are able to produce EVERY Tech 1 Frigate, Destoyer, Industrial, Cruiser, Battlecruiser, Battleship and Retrievers. We can also build Orcas and Freighters. 
</p>
<p>

If a Corp member wishes to purchase a ship the best thing to do is to actually mail Toshuu Milia (The Corps Manufacturing Director) saying what ship you would like buit and I can then provide you with a quote. Occasionally we do find that the ships are cheaper to buy off the market than from us (This is often due to changes in the mineral prices and the market not responding quickly enough). We have to ensure the corp at least covers the mineral costs of a ship when selling to our members.
</p>
<p>

We can also purchase Blueprint Copies to build and Faction ships on a case by case basis. 
</p>
<p>

I hope you see this as one of the `perks` of being in the corp and see this as a very viable way in which you can benefit from the Corp
